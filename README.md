# Vehicle Counter

This project is a vehicle counter implemented using OpenCV. It leverages the `cv.bgsegm.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG()` algorithm for background subtraction, which is a crucial step in object detection. The project could be extended to include different types of vehicles, track their speed, or even identify license plates.Future enhancements could include tracking different vehicle types, monitoring their speed, or identifying license plates.
